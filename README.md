# Next.js 15 Server Components Nested `use()` Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to deeply nested `use()` statements within server components.  Under certain conditions of deep nesting, the application might fail silently or throw an unexpected error, without any clear indication of the problem.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the problematic route (specified in the code). 

You'll likely observe either a silent failure (no data loaded) or a cryptic error in the browser's console.

## Solution

A solution involves restructuring the component hierarchy to reduce the nesting depth of `use()` statements.  Alternatively, consider using a different state management approach that avoids this particular issue.  See the `nestedUseSolution.js` file for a possible solution.
