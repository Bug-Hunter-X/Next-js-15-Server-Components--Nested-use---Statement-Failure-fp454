In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with deeply nested `use` statements.  If a server component deeply nests a `use` statement within multiple other components, the request might fail silently or throw an unexpected error. This is because the server component's context is not properly propagated across multiple layers of nested `use` statements. The error is subtle because there's no explicit error message, and it only manifests under specific conditions of nesting depth.
